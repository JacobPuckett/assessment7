Append scales better with larger numbers being able to run it faster but when it comes to lower numbers such as smallarray and tiny array insert was actually able to run it faster. From what I can see form the data the .push() is able to push large amounts of data faster and unshift can do small data faster. 

For extra credit: From my research when you use unshift it adds the element to the front of the array at the 0 index then it unshift all the other values that are higher than the index of 0. While push just adds an element to the end of your current array and then returns that element. From my understanding of that information the larger number would end up slowing down the unshift array and according to our data that we have gathered it would seem that way. I'm not sure why the unshift is faster at lower numbers though.
